                IP Addresses, Packets and Routing:
            </h1>
            <p>
                IP Addresses like home or business addresses, have different parts which help direct DNS Servers to a
                specific location. Any computer or smart device which is connected to the internet has a unique IP
                Address. These addresses are assigned by a DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which manages
                the local IP Addresses to avoid conflict within the network as well as conflicts with the Internet at
                large. These IP Addresses are mostly Dynamic, which means that they are automatically assigned and can
                be changed by the DHCP as needed. IPv4 IP Addresses uses 32 binary bits (or 4 bytes) to create a
                four-part address separated by a dotted-decimal. Using all different combinations of those 32 bits, IPv4
                could provide just under 4.3 billion unique IP Addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it was first implemented, the 4 billion unique addresses sounded like enough, but as the internet
                advanced, and the number of connected devices grew exponentially, a new solution was needed. In late
                1998, the IDTF, or Internet Engineering Task Force, created a platform for expanding the number of bits
                used in creating IP Addresses. The would be labeled as the 6th version of the Internet Protocol, or
                IPv6. IPv6 was developed to use 128 bits, which would allow for the creation of up to 340 undecillion
                (340 trillion trillion trillion) unique addresses. Fostering communication between that many devices
                would be unachievable if not for a brilliantly simple system which allows information to be shared
                across the entirety of the internet, with very little errors, known as a Network Packet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packets allow for computers to effectively communicate with each other, while avoiding any crossfire
                that might otherwise occur. Packets work by splitting a network communication into smaller pieces that
                are then distributed among the network and reassembled at the destination. When broken down into
                Packets, a message is split into three parts; the Header, the Payload, and the Trailer. The Header
                contains the descriptors of the message such as the size of the message, how many parts the message has
                been broken into, the destination and originating IP Addresses. The Payload contains the actual message
                being delivered, be it an email, a webpage, a music file, or a homework assignment. The Trailer is what
                tells the router that the whole packet has been received. Once it arrives at its destination, the Header
                and Trailer are discarded and the Payload is reassembled into the original message.
